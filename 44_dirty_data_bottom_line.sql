-- Dirty data represents faulty bits of information that can present problems in a business's database.


-- 1. Insecure data
-- * Delete outdated and unusable records
-- * Merge duplicates to prevent fragmented profiles
-- * Automate lead-to-account linking
-- * Consolidate your stack as much as possible

-- With a clean, organized and updated database,
-- complying with data privacy regulations becomes far more straightforward.


-- 2. Inconsistent Data

-- Inconsistent or non-standardized data looks different, but represents the same thing.


-- 3. Too Much Data

-- Yes, data hoarding is a thing


-- 4. Duplicate Data

-- e.g. a single employee showing up twice under different companies, or with different job titles.

-- How do duplicates happen? Generally, you'll muddy your data with copies during data migrations and manual inputs

-- Before the age of mass data accumulation, manpower alone was enough to merge duplicates
-- and link leads to accounts.
-- Nowadays, there are automated solutions for detecting and merging duplicates.


-- 5. Incomplete Data

-- Without attributes like industry type, job title, or last name, you risk excluding valuable leads 
-- in your campaigns.


-- 6. Inaccurate Data

-- If your data is plain wrong, you run into all sorts of problems -
-- from missteps on cold calls to inaccurate reporting and decision-making.

-- It's far cheaper to verify and cleanse data regularly than to do nothing at all.


-- What are the Consequences of Dirty Data?

-- 1. Ineffective Marketing Campaigns

-- 2. Poor Customer Experience

-- 3. Damaged Brand Reputation

-- 4. Misinformed Decision-Making

-- 5. Misaligned Sales and Marketing Teams

-- 6. Decreased ROI from Sales and Marketing Technologies

-- 7. A Slower Sales Cycle

-- What is a Stored Procedure?

-- A stored procedure is a prepared SQL code that you can save,
-- so the code can be reused over and over again.

-- So if you have an SQL query that you write over and over again,
-- save it as a astored procedure, and then just call it to execute it.

-- You can also pass arguments to a stored procedure,
-- so that the stored procedure can act based on the parameter value(s) that is passed.

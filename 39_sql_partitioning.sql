-- Remember the days when a gigabyte was considered a lot of data? Yeah, me neither
-- Today, we're dealing with terabytes and petabytes of data,
-- and managing these massive datasets efficiently is no small feat.
-- This is where SQL partitioning comes in, offering a powerful tool
-- to divide and conquer large tables,
-- boosting performance, and simplifying data management,
-- compared to single partition table.


-- Why Use SQL Partitioning?
-- Imagine trying tofindasepcific book in a library with millions of books and no orgamization system.
-- It would be a nightmare! Partitioning is like organizing the library into different sections
-- based on genre, author, or publication date.
-- This makes it much easier to find what you're looking for.

-- Similarly, partitioning a large table in the dataset brings numerous advantages:

-- Enhanced Performance and Scalability
-- * Faster Queries
-- * Parallel Processing
-- * Efficient Data Management

-- Streamlined Data Management
-- * Data Lifecycle Management -- For example, older partitions can be archived or dropped effortlessly.
-- * Data Locality -- Partitions can reside on different storage devices, even different physical location.

-- Simplified Querying and Analysis
-- * Partition-based Queries
-- * Data Summarization

-- Partition Key
-- The partition key is the column or set of columns that determines how data is distributed across partitions.
-- Ideally, the partition key should be frequently used in query filters
-- to enabble efficient partition pruning.
-- Example:
-- Consider a table storing customer orders.
-- Partitoning the table by the order_date column would be a good choice
-- if queries often filter data based on specific date ranges.

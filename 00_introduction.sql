While retrieving data using SQLcan be simple, cleaning
and aggregating the data requires skills
that need to be practiced in order to master.
In this tutorial we learned several concepts
that will bring you to an advanced SQL skill level
including table joins, aliasing variables,
counting records and applying aggregate functions and grouping.

These concepts are important to know because companies
often keep data in different systesm or database tables,
leaving it up to data nalysts to join them together
and make sense of it all.
